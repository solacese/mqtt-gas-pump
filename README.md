# Solace MQTT Gas Pump Demo

## What does this demonstrate?

A demo of a web application using the MQTT API that transforms your mobile phone into a gas pump. A dashboard is also shown that, in real-time, shows the live capacity of a gas pump.

  
### Solace PubSub+ features used
- [WebSockets Messaging](https://docs.solace.com/Solace-PubSub-Messaging-APIs/JavaScript-API/Web-Messaging-Concepts/Web-Messaging-Architectures.htm)
- [MQTT](https://docs.solace.com/Open-APIs-Protocols/MQTT/MQTT-get-started.htm)

## Application Flow Diagram
![Application Flow](/docs/SUNCOR-DEMO-APP-DIAGRAM.png "Application Flow")

## Contents

This repository contains:

1. **[dashboard](dashboard/):** A ReactJS application that both controls the demo session and displays station data
2. **[mobile-app](mobile-web-app/):** A ReactJS application that simulates a gas-pump on your mobile phone


## Checking out

To check out the project, clone this GitHub repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/solacese/mqtt-gas-pump
cd mqtt-gas-pump
```

## Running the Demo

### To run the demo, you'll first need to edit a few config files:

```
dashboard/src/shared-components/solace/pubsubplus-config-EDITME.js
```
This config file provides the details to connect to your Solace PubSub+ broker.  Fill it out using the details found in the "Solace Web Messaging" section of the "Connect" tab on your cloud broker's management portal.  You'll probably want to use the Secure WebSocket URI.  As for "login_topic_prefix" and "start_topic_prefix," this is a matter of preference; the app is configured to publish messages on these topics. 

In addition, there is a property "topic_to_queue_mapping" which maps every pump to a queue. However, if speciying this property the code will need to create a queue and add a subscription via SEMPv2 since the javascript API does not support this directly at this point. To accomodate this, you will need to specify the admin username/password. In addition, you will need a mechanism to proxy your SEMP commands since SEMP does not support CORs. This can be accomplished via an AWS Lambda - a sample implementation is availble in [semp-lambda/semp-proxy.js](semp-lambda/semp-proxy.js). Also note, that there is no mechanism to clean up the queues available as the javascript api does not support temporary queues.

If you do not require to have events in a queue, set the property to false and anything below this property will not need to be specified.

```
mobile-app/src/shared-components/clients/mqtt-config-EDITME.js
```
Similarly, this is another config file that provides the details to connect to your Solace PubSub+ broker.  This file is used by an MQTT client.  Fill it out using the details found in the "MQTT" section of the "Connect" tab on your cloud broker's management portal.  For "mqtt_host," use the hostname of your brokerâ€”excluding the protocol prefix and port (e.g. somejumbleofletters.messaging.solace.cloud).  For "mqtt_port," use the port from the WebSocket Secured MQTT Host data URI.  
   
### Next, you'll need to make sure you have parcel installed for running your dev server and/or building the app:
```
npm install -g parcel-bundler
```
Parcel is awesome for JS development, check it out [here](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html)

### Once you have parcel installed, you can run the following commands from inside either of the two apps to run the server locally or build the app for distribution:
```
npm run dev
npm run build
```
The output from the build command will be found in the dist/ folder at the root level of the app.  An easy way to host these files is to upload them to S3 and use the bucket for [static website hosting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html).

### My servers are running, what now?
Once you have the servers running for both the dashboard app and the mobile app, you'll want to navigate to the homepage of the dashboard server and follow the flow as prompted by the app.
